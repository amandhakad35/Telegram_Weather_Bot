A Telegram weather bot is an automated program that provides weather information to users through the Telegram messaging app. Users can interact with the bot to get weather updates for specific locations, subscribe to receive weather updates, and get current weather data. Some weather bots also provide forecasts, humidity, wind speed, and other meteorological data. Users can interact with the bot using text or GPS coordinates.
